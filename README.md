# Intermediate SQL - Sales Analysis 
## Overview
Analysis of customer behavior, retention, and lifetime value for an e-commerce company to improve customer retention and maximize revenue.

## Business Questions
1. **Customer Segmentation:** Who are our most valuable customers?
2. **Cohort Analysis:** How do different customer groups generate revenue?
3. **Retention Analysis:** Which customers haven't purchased recently?

## Analysis Approach
### 1. Customer Segmentation Analysis
- Categorized customers based on total lifetime value (LTV)
- Assigned customers to High, Mid, and Low-value segments
- Calculated key metrics: total revenue

🖥️ Query: [1_customer_segmentation.sql](1_customer_segmentation.sql)

**📈 Visualization:**

📊 **Key Findings:**
- High-value segment (25% of customers) drives 66% of revenue ($135.4M)
- Mid-value segment (50% of customers) generates 32% of revenue ($66.6M)
- Low-value segment (25% of customers) accounts for 2% of revenue ($4.3M)

💡 **Business Insights**
- High-Value (66% revenue): Offer premium membership program to 12,372 VIP customers, as losing one customer significantly impacts revenue
- Mid-Value (32% revenue): Create upgrade paths through personalized promotions, with potential $66.6M → $135.4M revenue opportunity
- Low-Value (2% revenue): Design re-engagement campaigns and price-sensitive promotions to increase purchase frequency


### 2. Cohort Analysis
- Tracked revenue and customer count per cohorts
- Cohorts were grouped by year of first purchase
- Analyzed customer retention at a cohort level

🖥️ Query: [2_cohort_analysis.sql](/2_cohort_analysis.sql)

**📈 Visualization:**

📊 **Key Findings:**
- The exponential trend line highlights a consistent drop in revenue per customer from 2019 onward.
- The 2023 and 2024 cohorts show the lowest customer revenue in the last 10 years.
- Although total net revenue is increasing, this is likely due to a larger number of customers. That growth does not reflect improved customer value, which is actually declining.

💡 **Business Insights**
- The value extracted from each customer is declining over time, as seen in the downward trend of customer revenue by cohort. This suggests newer customers are less valuable and calls for deeper investigation into acquisition channels, onboarding experience, and product-market fit.
- In 2023 we saw a drop in number of customers acquired, which is concerning.
- With falling LTV and acquisition, the company faces a potential revenue downturn.

### 3. Customer Retention

🖥️ Query: [3_retention_analysis.sql](3_retention_analysis.sql)

**📈 Visualization:**

<img src="images/3_customer_churn_cohort_year.png" alt="Customer Churn by Cohort Year" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">


📊 **Key Findings:**  

- Cohort churn stabilizes at ~90% after 2-3 years, indicating a predictable long-term retention pattern.  
- Retention rates are consistently low (8-10%) across all cohorts, suggesting retention issues are systemic rather than specific to certain years.  
- Newer cohorts (2022-2023) show similar churn trajectories, signaling that without intervention, future cohorts will follow the same pattern.  


💡 **Business Insights:**

- Strengthen early engagement strategies to target the first 1-2 years with onboarding incentives, loyalty rewards, and personalized offers to improve long-term retention.  
- Re-engage high-value churned customers by focusing on targeted win-back campaigns rather than broad retention efforts, as reactivating valuable users may yield higher ROI.  
- Predict & preempt churn risk and use customer-specific warning indicators to proactively intervene with at-risk users before they lapse.


## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Customer Value Optimization** (Customer Segmentation)
   - Launch VIP program for 12,372 high-value customers (66% revenue)
   - Create personalized upgrade paths for mid-value segment ($66.6M → $135.4M opportunity)
   - Design price-sensitive promotions for low-value segment to increase purchase frequency

2. **Cohort Performance Strategy** (Customer Revenue by Cohort)
   - Target 2022-2024 cohorts with personalized re-engagement offers
   - Implement loyalty/subscription programs to stabilize revenue fluctuations
   - Apply successful strategies from high-spending 2016-2018 cohorts to newer customers

3. **Retention & Churn Prevention** (Customer Retention)
   - Strengthen first 1-2 year engagement with onboarding incentives and loyalty rewards
   - Focus on targeted win-back campaigns for high-value churned customers
   - Implement proactive intervention system for at-risk customers before they lapse
